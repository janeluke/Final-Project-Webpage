               A look into the inflow and outflow of remittances to understand the global remittance landscape in order to highlight the ideal geographies for remittance-based aid development initiatives. The proposed work is an e-commerce platform that would enable senders of remittances to purchase sustainable energy products of their choice for family members in their country of origin. Sustainable energy products can include: solar panels, solar water pumps, solar power generators, solar water heaters,wind power equipment, bioenergy heating stove, hydro energy electric lamp, clean cooking fuels/devices, etc. The inputs for this work include an estimated budget, staff salaries for both administrative and technical teams, and an enabling regulatory environment. There are two main activities for this project: (1) remitters purchasing items on an e-commerce platform and (2) the procurement of green products and services. The main output of this project is that remittance-receivers gain access to green energy products and services and the outcome is increased utilization of green energy products in the Global South.<br><br>

This work will directly or indirectly address the following SDGs:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Affordable and clean energy</li>
  <li>Sustainable cities and communities</li>
  <li>Responsible consumption and production</li>
  <li>Climate action</li>
</ul>
		  


We set out to understand the global remittance and green energy environments in order to determine the feasibility of remittance-based aid in achieving the SDGs. Research has been conducted with the goal of assessing the feasibility of an in-kind, e-procurement remittance system (recipients receive green goods and services instead of money). <br><br>

              Why is this important?<br><br>
              
              For this study, we understood remittances to be cross-border, voluntary monetary and non-monetary (in-kind) transfers made by migrants and diaspora members, individually or collectively, to people or communities in their home countries. Remittances have become an increasingly important source of development finance for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as remittance flows have surpassed official development assistance (ODA) and are more consistent than other sources, such as foreign direct investment (FDI) and private debt and investment equity. <br>

Minimize Harm Ethics<br><br>
  
              It is also very important that we should understand the harm minimization logic during the projects. All programming should be rooted in Minimize Harm ethics. It’s impossible to do no harm or zero harm when we implement projects, but we can try our best to minimize harm. It will be crucial to work with local utility providers, delivery and installation companies, etc. We don’t want to disrupt local supply chains or stir up conflict when we can avoid it.

          To further assess global remittance flows, we broke down the developing world into three broad geographic categories and highlighted the countries receiving the highest value of remittances within each key geography. Using this breakdown, we aimed to understand the magnitude of remittance flows to the region (including GDP), common ways of remitting, and to build a broad profile of the receivers and uses.<br>

2. Africa, with a focus on Egypt and Nigeria<br>

	            <div class="text"><h5>Asia</h5>
	            <hr style="border-color: white">
		        <p>
				The Asian countries receiving the largest remittance inflows overall (1980-2021e) are India ($1.216 trillion), China ($937 billion), and Philippines ($540 billion). Other important countries are South Korea($181 billion), and Indonesia ($150 billion). Remittances in Asia are  mainly cash transfers, rather than in-kind remittances. The  most common ways of sending remittances in Asia include Western Union, Remitly, WorldRemit, Transferwise, and Bank of China & Alipay for China<sup>[1]</sup>.<br><br>

For most countries in Asia, we can tell that remittances do not contribute a significant portion to their GDP. Only 8 countries in Asia experience remittances comprising more than 10% of their GDP. These countries are Lebanon (34.8%), Kyrgyz Republic (30.1%), Tajikistan (27.8%), and Nepal (24.8%). We also want to mention that, compared to East Asian countries (China: 0.13%, Japan: 0.1%, South Korea: 0.45%), South and Southeast Asian countries (Philippines: 9.7%, India: 3.1%, Vietnam: 6.3%) rely more on remittances to contribute to GDP, because East Asian countries have more developed industries that can support economic growth than Southeast Asian and South Asian countries.<br><br>

For the Philippines, less than 10% of lower income households receive remittances. This number increases consistently through the higher income quintiles<sup>[2]</sup>, exceeding 35% for the fifth quintile. We also found that higher socioeconomic status (SES) peoples have greater access to international remittances in other countries (China, South Korea, etc.). In terms of consumption patterns in Asia, households spend a large portion of remittances on daily consumption and basic or “public sector” expenditures, including house-building, festivals, primary education (providing school fees for migrant family members), and basic health care. Chinese people save most of their remittances, as there is a strong culture of saving in China.<br>

            	<hr style="border-color: white">
		        <p>
		    		The African countries receiving the largest remittance inflows overall (1980-2021e) are Egypt ($381 billion), Nigeria ($347 billion), Morocco ($163 billion), Tunisia ($49 billion), and Ghana ($37 billion). It is clear that Egypt and Nigeria are receiving the greatest amount of remittances–soaring magnitudes above other countries in the African top 10. Egypt and Nigeria are also the top 2 richest African countries due to their rapidly growing economies, the rise in oil prices benefitting oil-producing countries worldwide, and perhaps partially due to the massive amount of remittance inflows they receive. <br><br>

For these two countries, remittances do not comprise a significant portion of their GDP (8.4% and 3.7% respectively), as they are able to benefit from other robust industries such as petroleum (imports and exports), agricultural production, tourism, and more. This is in stark contrast to countries in which remittances make up a large portion of their GDP, including South Sudan (38%), Gambia (34%), Somalia (32%), and Lesotho (24%). These nations seem to overly rely on remittance inflows due to ongoing conflict stifling economic growth in the case of South Sudan and Somalia, an underdeveloped economy in the Gambia, and proximity to a much more robust economy for Lesotho.<br><br>

The most common ways to send remittances in Africa are through Western Union and Moneygram–which take up 20% of the market<sup>[3]</sup>–in addition to Transferwise and Mpesa. Another common method is Hawala: person-to-person delivery that bypasses economic sanctions, transfer costs, and formal ID requirements. The Hawala system refers to an informal channel for transferring funds from one location to another through service providers—known as hawaladars—regardless of the nature of the transaction and the countries involved. While hawala transactions are mostly initiated by migrant workers living in developed countries, the hawala system can also be used to send funds from developing countries abroad<sup>[4]</sup>. This system is helpful for those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because money transfers cost more than the global average here. In SSA, transfers incurred an average of 8.9% in fees in 2019, compared to the global average of 6.8%. Experts advise that a more sustainable solution to bringing the benefits of low-cost, secure, and efficient digital remittances to sub-Saharan Africa involves establishing nationally recognized digital identity systems<sup>[5]</sup>.<br><br>

According to IFAD, one in five people in Africa send or receive international remittances (without considering domestic flows). The Nigerian diaspora is one of the largest African immigrant populations in the world, with a global population of 1.7 million in 2020. The diaspora mainly consists of semi-skilled, skilled and highly skilled professionals that are able to consistently send remittances back home. Most remittances received cover daily needs, with a portion (~25%) allocated for savings or investment<sup>[6]</sup>. The World Bank reported that most of the funds are used for household consumption, while some are used for education, health and other human capital development. Another portion is invested in land, livestock or housing construction, however little is used for investments, such as savings or business, or to repay debt<sup>[7]</sup>.<br>

		    		Latin America, particularly Central America and Mexico, was the only region in the world to see an increase in remittances in 2020 (1%). Central Americans and Mexicans receive remittances primarily from the United States, and almost all remittances are used to cover basic needs: food, health, and housing <sup>[8]</sup>. The most common way of sending remittances in this geography is via bank transfers and money transfer services. Foreign exchanges like Western Union, MoneyGram, OFX, TransferWise, and Xoom are utilized. OFX is the cheapest money transfer method in Mexico, but is still overshadowed by the use of Western Union. There are also newer, more enterprising foreign exchange services like Stellar, a platform that enables people to create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of money: dollars, pesos, bitcoin, etc. Stellar was designed so all the world’s financial systems can work together on a single network, though it is worth noting that given the delayed establishment of cryptocurrency laws, it may be used for illicit purposes.<br>

Mexico has received 600 billion in remittances over the last ~20 years (1980-2021e). Mexico and Central America receive their remittances mainly from the U.S., while the rest of Latin America receives most remittances from Mexico, neighboring South American countries, and Spain. Countries in the region with the highest percentage of remittances accounting for GDP are Honduras (26.6%), El Salvador (26.2%), Jamaica (23.6%), Guatemala (18%), and Nicaragua (15.5%).<br><br>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Research Questions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          According to our analysis, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates are amongst the top 10 remittance senders, which aligns with existing research. It is well- documented that these nations are important parts of the global remittance landscape. In turn, India, China, Mexico, and the Philippines are the top 4 remittance-receiving countries. Current research on the global remittance landscape shows that these countries comprise the world’s top remittance corridors—a term for the sum of remittance flows between two countries. The top remittance corridors are U.S. to Mexico, UAE to India, Hong Kong to China, U.S. to China, U.S. to India, and U.S. to the Philippines. We were not given access to bilateral remittance data from the World Bank, so with our limited view, we sought to further assess the global remittance landscape.<br><br>

In addition to understanding the global remittance landscape, it was necessary to assess the energy landscape within the selected geographic categories. For this assessment, we aimed to understand the energy gaps in each area, accessibility of sustainable energy, and the current environment of sustainability remittance-focused projects specifically. To understand the global remittance environment and determine the feasibility of sustainability remittance-based aid in achieving the SDGs.<br><br>

Our assessments of the global remittance landscape and energy needs within key geographies provided insights on the potential intersection between remittance finance and sustainable energy solutions. With this high-level perspective, it was equally important to get an understanding of consumer demand for this type of project. After all, remittances are sent from one party to another. The question became how to encourage both parties to give up some autonomy in order to participate in this kind of initiative. We designed a demand survey targeting remitters and conducted an expert interview in order to gain deeper insights on potential consumer interest. <br><br>
		
		Remitter Survey <br><br>
Out of 35 respondents, 33 reported sending money or goods to loved ones in another country.<br>

Remitters were from (and sent money back to):<br><br>
China (6), Nigeria (4), the Philippines (3), India, Mexico, Madagascar (2 each), Afghanistan, Sudan, Nicaragua, Kenya, Hong Kong, Argentina, Honduras, Ghana, Georgia, Eritrea, Colombia, Brazil, Syria, Sierra Leone, and Syria (1 each). Despite a relatively small sample size, the respondents cover a very broad geographic range.<br><br>
		</figure>
		  <img src="img/marketresearchsend.png" alt="Remittance sent from">
	    </figure>
<br><br>
As for the recipients, respondents primarily sent money/goods to: <br><br>
Parents (16), siblings (9), aunts, uncles, or cousins (9), grandparents (6), greater community (6), friends (3), and children (1).<br><br>
		</figure>
		 <img src="img/marketresearch.png" alt="Remittance sent to">
</figure>
<br><br>		
In terms of preferred transfer platforms:
A large majority of respondents (19) identified Western Union as one of the platforms they use to send remittances abroad, followed by Moneygram (5), Bank of China (3), Xoom (2), WorldRemit, Mpesa, Indian Bank, Remitly, Chipper, Binance, Sendwave, and Zelle (1 each). 

Respondents also shared challenges they experienced with sending remittances:

<ul>
  <li>Transaction fees</li>
  <li>Varying financial systems</li>
  <li>Lack of trust in existing institutions</li>
</ul>

		</figure>
		<img src="img/challenges.png" alt="Transfer Platform">
</figure>
<br><br>		
In terms of expenses, respondents shared that their loved ones primarily spent remittances on:
Household (27), education (10), medical (10), savings (2), and business (1).<br><br>
This finding aligns with global research, which purports that remittances are mostly spent on basic necessities such as food, clothing and shelter. Once those needs are satisfied, the remainder is invested in human capital, health and education, or housing.<br>
Middle-income groups tend to utilize their remittances for business expenses, savings, and investments. Respondents here are mostly middle- to high-income earners, but their family members are still using most of the funds to meet their immediate needs.<br><br>
		</figure>
		<img src="img/remittanceused.png" alt="Remittance Expenses">
</figure>
<br><br>
The final question–and perhaps the most important–asked respondents if they would consider paying directly for clean energy products as opposed to sending cash. <br><br>
About half of the respondents said No (51.4%), and the other half were roughly split between Yes (22.9%) and Maybe (25.7%).
The green remittances proposal is much more complex than what could be expressed in this brief survey with a relatively small sample size. Still, respondents provided valuable insights into real-life constraints to be considered, as well as potential adaptations that would make the proposal more attractive or feasible.<br><br>
In addition to the constraints caused by financial institutions mentioned above (ie. wait time, transaction fees, varying systems), respondents also identified cultural and contextual barriers. Tradition runs deep in many societies. People may be hesitant to adopt certain technologies because they are not familiar with them and would prefer their current way of life. For example, some communities are hesitant to adopt clean cooking solutions because they simply prefer cooking over a wood fire to maintain traditional recipes or taste.<br><br>
Respondents from lower-income countries also stressed that their loved ones’ basic needs for food and shelter must be met first, and this initiative does not seem to be in line with that. As it stands, the proposal may only benefit the middle and upper class. These concerns go hand-in- hand with another issue raised: the general lack of awareness about energy issues in various contexts. Energy access is a basic necessity that can improve people’s lives in countless ways. Green remittance projects must make a stronger connection between energy poverty and quality of life so that people understand what is really at stake and how they can immensely benefit in terms of health, personal finance, community, environment, and more.<br><br>

GIS mapping becomes quite important to plan where technology is to be installed. Geolocating will be important, so GIS experts would be a useful part of project staff.  In remote areas, there has to be buy-in from the community for “last mile” of delivery, as supply chain will not be able to reach remote places. Geolocation using smartphone and/or SMS can help, as well as <a href = https://what3words.com/clip.apples.leap>What3words</a>, who are working to geocode remote areas.<br><br>

Shipping goods by sea to importers in-country is relatively achievable. Landlocked countries will be more challenging and take longer, reinforcing the need for regional partners and country-specific partners to establish supply chain. <br><br>

DHL can courier a single product into the capital city. After that, local networks of providers or delivery companies will be needed to disseminate outwards to other regions. There will need to be significant communication between recipients and delivery drivers, as door-to-door service is not particularly feasible. Drop-off hubs or agreed upon meeting points would be useful.<br><br>

Research needs to be done to not disrupt local supply chains. It’s important to work hand in hand with local utility providers, for example, so as not to disrupt the market. There are often concerns about equity of distribution and its effects. If one household receives installation of X product, how will other members of the community react? To avoid this, centralized installation is recommended.<br><br> 

Central industrial power at the village or communal level is a win-win. Community members can utilize that power source to outsource to smaller energy units in residences.<br>

The idea of leveraging remittances is not a new concept within the context of Southeast Asia. However, remittance-based projects within this specific geography have focused on (1) cash remittances and (2) finance-based development projects. With these considerations, Southeast Asia might not be the most suitable place for a green remittance project.<br><br>

In terms of why we need to rule out China, I think the following reasons may lead to great obstacles and risks in the implementation of the project in China: Though sustainable finance is developing fast in China, the whole sustainable finance concept is quite new in China and it includes green remittance. So we really do not have too many case studies for our reference. It’s still at an early stage.We also found that research on remittance in China is more about domestic migration and remittance. There are not lots of research and projects about  international remittance.<br><br>

We should also be careful about the strict regulations towards international organizations and projects that China does not feel familiar with or have their own purposes. China has its own concern. Government thinks NGO and development projects are great but the capital behind them always has their own political standing and they worry about too much involvement in politics. But I don’t think it’s a huge challenge or problem if we can follow the laws and rules and work together with the local institutions and local sustainable energy projects(like solar energy projects).<br><br>

Local adoption of projects and sustainable energy related to life behavior of local people, efficiency of sustainable equipment and culture deep in their mind. This is also one of the main reasons I think why rule out China.No matter high income or low income, Chinese people love to save money. Through surveys and research, even if Chinese people have extra money or remittances, they prefer to save money instead of paying for sustainable equipment. For Chinese people, they will try their best to save money from their basic needs consumption.So it would be particularly hard to persuade them to take a certain proportion of their money to pay for sustainable products every year.<br><br>

We are also worried about the efficiency of solar energy products. The number of solar energy equipment in rural China began to decrease in the past few years. Because the solar system is very unstable in some places in China. Especially in South China, where it may rain continuously for a month. At this time, the solar system is not very useful. Also some places in China are really cold and have heavy snow, so solar equipment would experience damage and have to be replaced quite often. Apparently, the cost is increasing. We can use backup energy and manual recharger to alleviate this situation to some extent.<br><br>

Implementation Opportunities<br><br>

Initially, our spotlight was on countries receiving large remittance inflows that also had large energy needs. After analyzing the results of our market research, we recommend a pilot program targeting middle-income countries such as Egypt and Mexico, because there are likely fewer people struggling to meet their basic needs. Before developing a green remittance platform at the global level, a targeted pilot program would enable the testing of the platform’s key components, such as secure remitter-to-receiver financial transactions, supply chain management, service delivery, maintenance, customer satisfaction, and measurable development outcomes.<br><br>

As discussed, it is necessary to contextualize the sustainable energy solutions offered to each country. We envision an e-commerce application that is remitter-facing. The app must include a catalog of sustainable energy products that are tailored to that specific country/region. The selection of products for each contextualized catalog would require detailed research and assessment of local/national energy needs, narrowing down the plethora of possible sustainable energy solutions to a customized catalog of offerings. This approach would provide the best user-experience for remitters, with the potential to be very impactful in specified geographies.<br><br>

Another key insight that came from market research was the importance of energy-related education and knowledge sharing. The general lack of knowledge around energy issues and the disconnect between energy poverty and quality of life are more severe in low- and middle-income countries, relative to high-income countries. Along with the launch of a remitter-facing e-commerce application, we recommend an accompanying campaign for energy-related education that targets both parties, with a predominant focus on the remittance-receiver. This may be as simple as marketing or user-friendly application design on the remitter-end. However sharing knowledge with remittance-receivers would require additional time and investment through print, media, and in-person outreach. Outreach at the communal level can be very impactful, as we have learned that consumers are interested in maintaining their one-on-one financial relationships as well as contributing to a pooled fund for communal development. It will do little good if only a few households have access to refrigeration, clean cooking facilities, or solar power generators. In fact, this will likely perpetuate social inequity. We recommend considering sustainable solutions that can be shared amongst a broader group of community members.<br><br>

In regards to project implementation, it is clear that forming partnerships is a critical part of this kind of initiative. The concept of sustainable development is rooted in enabling disenfranchised communities to support themselves, as opposed to importing “answers” from the outside. Realistically, back-end platform managers cannot possibly do it all, and will not be the ones installing the devices or assuring maintenance in-country. Therefore it is necessary to involve existing utility companies that have the tools and talent to support customer-facing aspects. Existing green remittance platforms have benefitted from partnering directly with local energy providers, e-commerce platforms, and mobile phone app developers. We recommend utilizing third party contracts (TPCs) to enable effective delivery of sustainable energy solutions as well as promote sustainable development.<br><br>

International financial institutions (IFIs) can be key partners in the implementation of this platform. Our market research showed that a large majority of respondents used Western Union to send remittances. For the purpose of sending money, they have an online presence in 75 countries and territories, of which more than 50 countries have transactional mobile apps. For the purpose of receiving money, they have a global account network reaching 125 countries, paying out into billions of bank accounts, wallets, and cards, as well as a retail network with 550,000 locations across urban, rural, and remote parts of the world <sup>[9]</sup>. They report that digital cross-border payments comprised 34% of transactions and 23% of revenues for their consumer-to-consumer segment. In addition to dominating the market in SSA, Western Union has seen 77% transaction growth in digital money transfer, ahead of its peers (Moneygram, Transferwise, Paypal, and Ria) by a wide margin. Their digital growth has been led by the US, France, UK, Australia, and Germany; four of which are in the top 10 remittance senders globally (Table 1).<br><br>

Western Union engages in corporate social responsibility through its Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Strategy. Their ESG Strategy lists 3 priority areas: (1) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; (2) Integrity of Global Money Movement; and (3) Economic Prosperity. Additionally, their strategy explicitly mentions their support of the UN SDGs. They claim to focus specifically on Goal 1 (No Poverty), Goal 5 (Gender Equality), Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) <sup>[10]</sup>. There seems to be very fertile ground here, so we recommend forming a partnership with Western Union. It may be possible to link the green remittance e-commerce platform to the existing fin-tech software of this major IFI—akin to how Zelle has linked itself to a number of banks. Similarly, the lure of little to no transaction fees can help move a significant share of the market towards engaging with this platform.<br><br>
